# An Introduction to Network Analysis and Representation

As I grew more interested in network analysis, and more familiar especially with D3's force-directed layout, I found myself teaching workshops that I was woefully underqualified to teach. This tool was developed to help me better understand the fundamentals of network analysis and share those with putative workshop participants.

## What went right

I think the spatial problem explanation (which I would later deal with in more detail in one of my Gestalt essays) was really important. I had to write my own pathfinding and breadth first search algorithms, which any first-year CS student would have experienced but for me, a philosophy major, was incredibly valuable for better understanding network analysis.

## What went wrong

Just look at it. There are so many blank spots throughout it where documentation is supposed to go.

## The next version would have
Probably some kind of live-coding capability.
