# Humanities Networks Trailer

After building the primitive animation of the Arab Spring Wikipedia Edits, I wanted a way to script higher quality network animations. I used the Gephi Toolkit to script the filtering and screenshots, which were piped into ffmpeg to create these high-resolution movies.

## What went right

The inspiration for this work was the response of viewers to that phase in force-directed network layouts when a network is first laid out or adjusts in response to a filter. It recorded that phase, and used the high-resolution Presentation Mode in Gephi to create beautiful animations.

## What went wrong

Nothing went wrong with the process, but ultimately the results of the movies was no greater understanding of the networks, and instead they were just pretty.

## The next version would have

A script.
