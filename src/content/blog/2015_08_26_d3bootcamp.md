# Complex Data Visualization with D3.js Boot Camp

On November 7-8 Zan Armstrong and I will be running a 2-day bootcamp on doing complex data visualization with D3.js.

The bootcamp will cover creating geospatial, hierarchical, network and custom data visualization.

Details and tickets for the bootcamp can be found here:

When I first started writing [D3.js in Action](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292117/), I felt there was already a really great [intro to D3 by Scott Murray](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QYZE5T2CQ7VB9BS66KF) and more than enough introductory tutorials to satisfy anyone trying to learn D3. So, I wrote the book with an eye to explaining the more advanced aspects of the library. After looking at the workshops and courses for D3 available, I realized there were also enough intro and basic courses for D3. So, I designed a 2-day bootcamp for developers familiar with D3 who wanted to learn not only how to use its advanced functionality but wanted to create actionable data visualization products that took into account the challenges of leveraging complex data visualization methods.

As a result, this bootcamp is not suitable for beginners wanting to get into D3, and won't teach you the basics of the enter/exit/update pattern, scales, and generators like `d3.svg.axis`. Instead, this will consist of four deep dives into the four pillars of data visualization: **Geospatial Information Visualization** (including choropleth maps, topojson, and tile mapping with D3), **network data visualization** (following the pattern of my earlier [network data visualization workshop](http://elijahmeeks.com/networkviz/)), **hierarchical data visualization** (including an in-depth examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the many hierarchical data visualization layouts available in D3), and custom graphical drawing with D3 (taught by [Zan](http://blog.zanarmstrong.com/about/)).

Zan and I both have extensive practical experience with D3, both large and small projects, as well as significant experience teaching and designing courses, so you can expect answers to your trickiest D3 questions as well as thoughtful course material to help you both at the bootcamp and afterward.

*Scholarships are available for underrepresented groups that might have a hard time with the workshop cost, please contact Zan or I for details.*
