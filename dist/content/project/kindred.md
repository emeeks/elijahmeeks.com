# Kindred Britain

An interactive scholarly work looking at British cultural elites connected by marriage and lineage. It provides three views: the network, a timeline, and the geography of the events its subjects took part in. Written entirely in D3 with a custom UI.

## What went right

I really love the Stories feature that links views in the network to passages in the text.

## What went wrong

Scott Murray, who designed the site, had more ambitious drawings for various UI elements, such as a teardrop shape that connected timelines, which I didn't have the D3 skill at the time to create. The geography view was just too limited.

## The next version would have
I have it on good authority that there will be a next version, and wouldn't want to spoil it.
