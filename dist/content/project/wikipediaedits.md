# Wikipedia Edits During the Arab Spring

Early on in my experience with Gephi, I found the layout algorithms and their response to filtering to be rhetorically powerful. The Arab Spring was in full force, and I'd always been interested in Wikipedia, so I decided to look at how Wikipedia pages came into existence for the various revolutions and whether the people making them were the same people editing the pages associated with the countries where the revolutions were taking place.

The result was a moving 7-day window that tracked the edits being made to various pages, created simply by recording Gephi in its Layout mode.

## The next version would have

It would run off of DBPedia and let people curate their own semantically interesting periods of change in Wikipedia.
